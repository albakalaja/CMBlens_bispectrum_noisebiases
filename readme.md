# Compute the noise biases of the CMB lensing bispectrum
Clone the repo and use it!
Packages needed:
- numpy,
- numba,
- camb,
- multiprocessing,
- vegas for numerical integration,
- (optional) cmblensplus for the quadratic estimator, theoretical bispectrum, etc.

In notebooks/quickstart.ipynb there's an example of how to use the different modules to get the N0 and N1 noise biases for the power spectrum.
